We wanted to build a creative game that would make the users think about how their decisions would impact their fate. Will their character survive the sinking of Titanic and the icy cold waters or will they drown?

This game basically takes in the user inputs as their course of actions and in the end brings them to the consequence of their actions; whether they survive the fall or drown. We have a number of inputs for now such as whether the character could swim or not, the position of the character on the titanic at the point of the crash, their age and so on.

We built this using mainly Django, Scikit-learn, Python, CSS and Bootstrap. We trained our decision trees model using our own created dataset of Titanic passengers. We connected it to Django web app to collect user information of the passenger details and use those details to predict the survival of the passenger with our trained model.

We faced many challenges. All of us were complete beginners when it came to Django so we had to first learn the basics of Django and how we could use Django with Scikit-learn to train our prediction model. We also encountered many issues with our system where our python environment just wouldn't work and Windows was creating lots of problems but we eventually resolved them.

We are really proud of the fact that we were able to learn new software like Django and Scikit-learn. Even though, our model is quite simple, it has lots of room for progress and we could use it as a base to create a much fun and complex game. We are proud of ourselves for not giving up despite all the challenges we faced and were able to accomplish what we wanted to achieve.

We learned to get out of our comfort zone and try out new things. We were not afraid to face all the problems that we would encounter.

We aim to create a more comprehensive dataset and train our model more. We would like to make the game more interesting and have more user functions and scenarios. Basically, we would like to create a game that would be extremely addictive and fun to play by all!
